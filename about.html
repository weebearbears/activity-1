<center>I'm a 19-year-old student now enrolled in FCPC's BSIT program, and my name is Vahron Inigo B. Pineda. I've always wanted to major in this since I'm so interested in how technology is always changing. I feel that the information and abilities I have acquired through my education will be relevant in my future profession. I've had a terrific time thus far attending FCPC, since the curriculum is demanding and difficult but also rewarding. The professors Â provided me a strong basis on which to construct upon as I continue on my academic journey. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me in the information technology industry.and I have faith that the knowledge I received at FCPC will equip me for success in this ever changing industry.</center>
